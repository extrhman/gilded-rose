# gilded-rose
MY Take on the GildedRose Kata

Code base is in C# using .Net Core 2.1
Created with Visual Studio Professional 2017 V15.9.3

Committed in steps to show my thought process on the refactoring.

Step #1 Make current code testable, New Test passed
Step #2 Refactor current code to be cleaner, understandable and more maintainable.  Tests still pass
Step #3 Modify tests for new business logic, making them fail
Step #4 Fix the logic, Tests pass again
